- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there) Iâ€™m @Kotxe
- Real name is Anastasia, if you want to know
- I love music and games)
- You can refer to me as he or she, I don't mind
- I speak Russian and English freely;)

Right now I'm studying such languages as: 
                                         Python
                                         - JavaScript
                                         - Html
                                         - C#
                                         (pretty much, huh)

So there might be lots of projects here (I hope so too)

Nice to meet you:Ð·
